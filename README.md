## üî® Building from Source

### **Requirements**
- Visual Studio 2022
- Boost 1.76 or newer

### **Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CoinFabrik/ClipboardShield.git
   ```
2. Open `Src\ClipboardFirewall.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build projects in **Release** in the following order:
   - **Batch build for all platforms:**
     1. CFManualInjector
     2. ClipboardFirewallDll
     3. InjectDll
   - Build **code_generation** and **trayicon**.
   - Run `hash_checker` to validate the hashes. If errors occur, rebuild **code_generation**.
   - Build **ClipboardFirewallService** and **DriverInstaller** for x64.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation from Binary

1. Download the latest binary release from GitHub Releases.
2. Extract Binary
1. Create a directory (`%DST%`) to store the executable files (e.g., `C:\Program Files\CoinFabrik\Clipboard Firewall`). Copy the following files:
   - `Src\bin\ClipboardFirewallDll32.dll`
   - `Src\bin\CFManualInjector32.exe`
   - `Src\bin\InjectDll32.exe`
   - `Src\bin\trayicon.exe`
   - `Src\bin64\ClipboardFirewallDll64.dll`
   - `Src\bin64\ClipboardFirewallService64.exe`
   - `Src\bin64\CFManualInjector64.exe`
   - `Src\bin64\InjectDll64.exe`
2. Move `driver_binary\x64\DeviarePD.sys` to `Src\bin64\Drivers\Vista\DeviarePD.sys`.
3. (Admin) From inside `Src\bin64`, run:
   ```sh
   DriverInstaller64.exe -installdriver
   ```
4. Create the config file at `%ProgramData%\CoinFabrik Clipboard Shield\config.txt` (refer to `/doc/sample/c/ProgramData/CoinFabrik Clipboard Shield/config.txt`).
5. (Admin) From inside `%DST%`, run:
   ```sh
   ClipboardFirewallService64.exe -install
   ```
6. (Admin) Start the service:
   ```sh
   net start ClipboardShield
   ```
7. Run `trayicon.exe` to monitor the service status.

## Usage

## üß™ Testing
To verify the security measures:
- Use a clipboard monitoring tool to check if unauthorized access is blocked.
- Run a script that attempts to read the clipboard and confirm that access is denied.
- Check the log files for any recorded access attempts

## üí° Contribution
If you would like to contribute:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new **branch** (`feature-new-functionality`).
- Submit a **pull request** with a clear description of the changes.
