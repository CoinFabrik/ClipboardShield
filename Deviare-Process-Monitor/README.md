# Deviare Process Monitor

Deviare Process Monitor is a kernel-mode component that watches process
execution and termination in realtime and notifies user-mode applications about
such events.

Because the only option in user-mode to detect starting and ending processes is
polling, Deviare Process Monitor becomes an excellent alternative if you want to
avoid unnecessary CPU usage.
